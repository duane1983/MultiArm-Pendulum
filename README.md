# The Experimental Multi-Arm Pendulum on a Cart

This repository is for our paper: "*[The Experimental Multi-Arm Pendulum on a Cart: A Benchmark System for Chaos, Learning, and Control.]()*" The following figure shows an overview of experimental system.

This repository contains the following files:
- All the CAD files needed to build the pendulum hardware.
- Link to the user's manuals that corresponds to some of the parts we used.
- The experimental data set collected from sing, double, and triple pendulum with and with out external excitation. We believe this data set will be extremely useful for the Machine Learning and AI community.
- A demo file for setting up the hardware system.
- Demo files for parameter estimation of the pendulum arm.

If you find our data set useful, please cite it as: (Leave empty for now, will update after all the files are uploaded)
