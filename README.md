# The Experimental Multi-Arm Pendulum on a Cart

This repository is for our paper: "*[The Experimental Multi-Arm Pendulum on a Cart: A Benchmark System for Chaos, Learning, and Control.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06231)*" The following figure shows an overview of the experimental system.

This repository contains the following files:
- All the CAD files needed to build the pendulum hardware.
- Link to the user's manuals that correspond to some of the parts we used.
- The experimental data sets of the **single, double, and triple pendulum** with and without external excitation. We believe this data set will be extremely useful for the Machine Learning and AI community to test their modeling algorithm. The slow-motion video data for the double pendulum can be accessed using this [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18hswoKMX7XHbXlS6c8SvPlhCQRHZldHe?usp=sharing).
- A demo file for setting up the hardware system and using it for data collection.
- Demo files for parameter estimation of the **single, double, and triple pendulum**.
