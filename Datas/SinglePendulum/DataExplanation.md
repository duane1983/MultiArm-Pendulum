# This folder contains the experimental data of the single pendulum on the cart system.

This folder contains the following files:
- SingleDataFreeSwing_1_Dt_0_0001.mat: This file contains recordings of the free-swing experiment of the single pendulum. The sampling time is dt=0.0001, with the pendulum cart mounted.
- SingleDataWithControl_1_Dt_0_0001.mat: This file cintains the recording of the single pendulum on the cart system with the cart moving back and forth. The sampling time is dt=0.0001. The movement of the cart along wih its velocity is stored in the "Distance" and "Velocity" structure.
- SingleDataWithControl_2_Dt_0_0001.mat: This file cintains the recording of the single pendulum on the cart system with the cart moving back and forth. The sampling time is dt=0.0001. The movement of the cart along wih its velocity is stored in the "Distance" and "Velocity" structure.
