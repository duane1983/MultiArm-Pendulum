# This folder contains the experimental data gathered from the triple pendulum system.

This folder contains following files:
- TripleDataFreeSwing_X_Dt_0_0001.mat: These files record the rotational angle and velocity of the triple pendulum with zero cart movement. The sampling rate is dt=0.0001(s).
- TripleDataWithControl_X_Dt_0_0001.mat: These files record the rotational angle and velocity of the triple pendulum with pendulum cart moving back and forth. The cart position and velocity are also recorded. The sampling rate is dt=0.0001(s).
